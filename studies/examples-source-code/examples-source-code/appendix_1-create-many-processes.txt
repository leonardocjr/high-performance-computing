if "./appendix_1-create-many-processes.exe" returns
	Failed on the creation of process i=18641
	fork: Resource temporarily unavailable
it is because you are trying to get above your "max user processes" limit; 
your current value may be retrieved by
	ulimit -u
		62145
this value gives the maximum number of simultaneous live processes under your username;
you can always decrease this value
	ulimit -u 62000
	ulimit -u
		62000	
but increasing requires root privileges:
	sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
	...
	rufino          soft    nproc           70000
	rufino          hard    nproc           70000
these changes will be applied after reboot (or if you logout and login);
an alternative is to use ssh onto the localhost to simulate a new login:
	ssh rufino@localhost
	ulimit -u
		70000
now, verify if "./appendix_1-create-many-processes.exe" creates all processes; 
you can always try to increase the limit (70000) to a higher value, if necessary.
